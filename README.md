# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

## What is EDA?

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, 
  often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data 
  can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.

- It is good practice to understand the data first and try to gather as many insights from it. EDA is all about making 
sense of data in hand, before getting them dirty with it.
